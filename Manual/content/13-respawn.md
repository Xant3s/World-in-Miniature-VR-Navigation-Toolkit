Allows the user to respawn the miniature model. This is especially useful if the user left the miniature model somewhere in the VE. It will be spawned at the userâ€™s
position using an offset specified beforehand.

**How to Use in Game**  
The user has to press the respawn button (X-button/primary left hand button).

**Setup**  
Requires no setup. This is one of the basic features.

**Configuration**  
No configuration required.

**Input Mappings**  
Assign 'Respawn' button in the input mappings.

**Note**  
This feature is always enabled by default. To disable it, don't assign any key mapping to the 'Respawn' button.
