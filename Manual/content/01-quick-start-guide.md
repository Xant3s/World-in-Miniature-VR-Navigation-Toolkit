## What is World-in-Miniature (WIM)?

Navigation is one of the most fundamental challenges
in Virtual Reality (VR). The world-in-miniature (WIM) metaphor allows players to travel in large-scale virtual environments (VEs) regardless of available physical space while maintaining a high-level overview of the VE. It relies on a hand-held, scaled-down duplicate of the entire VE, where the userâ€™s current position is displayed, and an interface provided to introduce his/her next movements. This scaled-down version of the VE is called WIM or miniature model.

## What is WIMVR?

World-in-Miniature VR Navigation Toolkit (WIMVR) is a Unity plugin that integrates and extends state-of-the-art interaction tasks and
visualization concepts to overcome open conceptual gaps and to
provide a comprehensive practical solution for traveling in VR.

- ```Cylinder Mask```
- ```HandL```
- ```HandR```
- ```IndexL```
- ```IndexR```
- ```Level```
- ```PreviewCamera```
- ```PreviewScreen```
- ```Spotlight Mask```
- ```ThumbL```
- ```ThumbR```
- ```WIM Level Old```
- ```WIM```



### Layers

To edit your project's tags and layers, select  ```Edit Layers``` from the ```Layers``` dropdown (see Fig. \ref{fig:EditTagsAndLayers}). You can also edit the tags in your project settings.

Make sure the following layers exist (exact spelling matters):

- ```Fingers```
- ```Hands```
- ```PinchGrabbable```
- ```Player```
- ```WIM```


### Layer Collision Matrix

Also, set up the layer collision matrix under `Project Settings -> Physics` so that the 'WIM' layer doesn't collide with any other layer except the 'Hands' layer (see Fig. \ref{fig:CollisionMatrix}).

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{content/res/LayerCollisionMatrix.png}

## Configure Scene

1. All gameobjects that are part of your level must be nested under an empty gameobject.
   - Tag this empty gameobject as 'Level'.
2. Add XR rig to the scene
   - Drag the 'XR Rig' prefab (`WIMVR/Prefabs/XR Rig`) into the scene
3. Add miniature model
   - Add *Miniature Model* prefab to scene
   - Make sure both the tag and layer are set to 'WIM'
   - Configure miniature model to your preferences (see [Chapter 1.6 'Configure Miniature Model'](#configure-miniature-model))
   - Press 'Generate WIM' button
4. Add a *PlayerInput* component to the WIM gameobject (see Fig. \ref{fig:PlayerInput})
   - Assign an input actions configuration file: You can either use the provided 'InputMapping' configuration or create a new one (`Assets -> Create -> Input Actions`).
   - [Optional] set the default scheme to XR
   - [Optional] set the default map to 'Miniature Model'
   - See Section \ref{section:ConfigureInput} on how to change the input mapping

## Configure Miniature Model \label{section:ConfigureMiniatureModel}

To configure the WIM, select the WIM gameobject in the scene. All settings are displayed in the *Miniature Model* component inspector.
The configuration is stored in a *WIMConfiguration* asset, so you have to assign one.
Therefore, you can either select an existing *WIMConfiguration* (see Fig. \ref{fig:AssignWIMConfiguration}) or crate a new one using the create menu (see Fig. \ref{fig:CreateWIMConfiguration}). You can quickly switch between multiple WIM configurations by exchanging the assigned *InputWIMConfigurationActions*.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{content/res/SelectWIMConfiguration.png}
    \caption{Select an existing WIM configuration.}
    \label{fig:AssignWIMConfiguration}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{content/res/CreateWIMConfiguration.png}
    \caption{Create a new WIM configuration by selecting `Create -> WIM -> Configuration` either from the Assets menu or the right-click menu in the Project window.}
    \label{fig:CreateWIMConfiguration}
\end{figure}

To add or remove features, add or remove their respective scripts to the gameobject. See [Chapter 2 'Features'](#features) for a comprehensive list of all features. Some features might add additional settings to the *Miniature Model* component inspector.

These are the basic settings:

- *Player Representation*: The player's representation (prefab) in the miniature model. Used to indicate player's current position and orientation. Can be picked up and placed somewhere else if destination selection method is set to 'pickup'.
- *Destination Indicator*: Indicates the currently selected destination in the miniature model.
- *Scale Factor*: The scale factor applied to the miniature model on creation. Smaller numbers will result in a smaller model. A value of '1' would not downsize the miniature model at all.
- *WIM Level Offset*: Initial miniature model offset relative to this (parent) gameobject.
- *Expand Colliders*: Amount by which colliders of all miniature model objects should be extended to make it easier to grab.
- *Destination Always on the Ground*: If active, the destination will automatically snap to ground level. This protects the player from being teleported to a location in mid-air.
- *Destination Selection Method*: How players choose a destination. Pickup: pickup and place player representation using index and thumb. Double-tap destination indicator using index to confirm. Touch: touch destination using index and press button. Press button to confirm.
- *Double Tap Interval*: Maximum time between two taps. Will not detect a double-tap if time is exceeded. Double-tapping the destination indicator is used to confirm a destination and start the travel phase when the pickup destination selection method is selected.
- *Semi-Transparent*: See [Chapter 2.15](#semi-transparent)
- *Transparency*: See [Chapter 2.15](#semi-transparent)
- *WIM Spawn at Height*: Default height to spawn the miniature model at.
- *Player Height (in cm)*: The player's height. No Exact value required.
- *WIM Spawn Distance*: Specifies how far away from the player the miniature model should be spawned.
- *Detect Arm Length*: See [Chapter 2.3](#experimental-detect-arm-length)
- *Adapt miniature model Size to Player Height*: Automatically adapt the miniature model's size to the player's height. The effect will be minimal. Also use scale factor.

## Configure Input \label{section:ConfigureInput}

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{content/res/PlayerInput.png}
    \caption{Player input}
    \label{fig:PlayerInput}
\end{figure}

To configure the player input, select the WIM gameobject in the scene.
The configuration is stored in a *InputActions* asset, so you have to assign one.
Therefore, you can either select an existing *InputActions* (see Fig. \ref{fig:PlayerInput}) or crate a new one using the create menu (`Assets -> Create -> Input Actions`). You can quickly switch between multiple input mapping configurations by exchanging the assigned *InputActions* configuration.

To edit the input mappings, open the *InputActions* asset by double-clicking it. Then, you can select the action you wish to modify and assign a new binding, or map the existing binding to another button. For information on how to edit Input Action Assets in the dedicated editor, see [Action Assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/ActionAssets.html#editing-input-action-assets).
