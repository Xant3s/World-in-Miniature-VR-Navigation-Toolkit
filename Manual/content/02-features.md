# Features

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of all features of the current version. To add a feature, add the respective script to the WIM instance. Some features can be configured. The configuration is stored in its own config file (very much like the miniature model configuration itself).
If a feature can be configured, its settings will be displayed in the miniature model inspector among the other settings. To remove a feature, remove the respective script from the WIM instance. Settings of disabled features will not be displayed until these features are activated again.
