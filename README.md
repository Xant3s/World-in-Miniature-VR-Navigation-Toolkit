# WIMVR: World-in-Miniature VR Navigation Toolkit

## What is World-in-Miniature (WIM)?

Navigation is one of the most fundamental challenges
in Virtual Reality (VR). The world-in-miniature (WIM) metaphor allows players to travel in large-scale virtual environments (VEs) regardless of available physical space while maintaining a high-level overview of the VE. It relies on a hand-held, scaled-down duplicate of the entire VE, where the userâ€™s current position is displayed, and an interface provided to introduce his/her next movements. This scaled-down version of the VE is called WIM or miniature model.

## What is WIMVR?

World-in-Miniature VR Navigation Toolkit (WIMVR) is a Unity plugin that integrates and extends state-of-the-art interaction tasks and
visualization concepts to overcome open conceptual gaps and to
provide a comprehensive practical solution for traveling in VR.

## How to Test


### Hardware Requirements

- tested with Oculus Quest and Unity 2020.1.10f1
- Recommended: Oculus Link cable

### Requirements

1. Install [correct Unity version](ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt) (recommended: install via [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download))
    - Make sure to also install modules:
      - Android Build Support
      - Android SDK & NDK Tools
      - OpenJDK
    - Or add modules to existing Unity installation (Unity Hub > Installs > Add Modules)
2. Install [Oculus App](https://www.oculus.com/setup/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository  
   ```$ git clone --recursive --depth 1 git@github.com:WIMVR-Plugin/WIMVR-Deployment.git```
2. Open in Unity
3. Make sure the build target is set to Android (File > Build Settings)
4. Make sure `OpenGLES3` is the only active graphics API (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings)
5. Make sure the Oculus Plugin is enabled for both PC and Android (Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management)

### How to Run Example

The `SimpleExample` scene can be used to test all features. There are two different methods to run this example.

1. Test via Oculus Link
   1. Make sure the Oculus App is running
   2. Connect the Oculus Quest to your PC using the Oculus Link cable
   3. Start Oculus Link (select Settings > Oculus Link from the Quest main menu)
   4. Press play in Unity
2. Test via standalone
   1. Connect the Oculus Quest to your PC
   2. Make sure Oculus Links is *not* running
   3. Build and run (File > Build & Run)
   4. No cable connection is required once the build process is finished and the .apk was transferred to the Quest

### Common Oculus Quest Issues

- **No image is rendered for the right eye** - set the Stereo Rendering Mode to Multiview (Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management > Oculus > Android)
- **Massive performance issues when running in standalone mode** - uncheck the 'Auto-Switch' setting on the PlayerInput component attached to the WIM instance
